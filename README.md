# BMO-X

**A bare-metal orchestrator that boots on real hardware and runs COBOL, C, C++,
Ada and INTI -- compiled by its own toolchain into its own executable format.
No LLVM. No GCC. No ELF. No QEMU.**

Written from scratch in Rust -- the boot chain, the kernel, the drivers, the
filesystem, **five native compilers** and the executable format they emit. It
boots on an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and occupies **5.4 MiB of 14.8 GiB of RAM**.

**2.197 commits - 1.523 files - 17 April to 21 September 2026 - one developer.**

**One architecture, on purpose.** The name of the kernel directory is
`Ultra_kernel_x86-64` and that is the whole portability story: BMO-X targets
x86-64 and nothing else, by decision (2026-09-18). The only architecture-neutral
code in the tree is the compiler *frontends*; every emitter, every driver and
every page table is x86-64, and a guardian (`isa`) fails the build if a second
architecture starts growing inside. ARM or RISC-V would be another repository
with another name -- not a `#[cfg]`.

<details>
<summary><b>En castellano</b> -- que es esto, en un parrafo</summary>

BMO-X no es un sistema operativo de proposito general y no aspira a serlo. Un
sistema operativo **multiplexa**: le miente a cada programa diciendole que esta
solo en la maquina. BMO-X **orquesta**: cada programa sabe su parte, su entrada
y lo que cuesta. Por eso la frontera entera con el sistema son **dos syscalls**
--`INVOKE` y `WAIT`-- y no trescientas.

La palabra es **BMO: Bare Metal Orquestal**, y no es un SO, un RTOS ni ninguna
otra caja prestada -- porque una categoria es una promesa que se hace sola, y
una expectativa que no se cumple es un informe de fallo que no se puede cerrar.
Multiplexar es ser generoso: un SO lo da todo por defecto y comprueba despues.
Orquestar es ser **celoso**: aqui no se da nada, se **presta**, y el prestamo
se acaba cuando el propietario quiere. Los ocho sitios del arbol donde eso esta
escrito --y las tres cosas que cuesta-- estan en
[`docs/identidad/EL_ORQUESTAL.md`](docs/identidad/EL_ORQUESTAL.md).

Esta escrito desde cero en Rust, en Lima, por una persona: la cadena de
arranque, el kernel, los drivers, el sistema de ficheros, cinco compiladores
nativos (C, C++, COBOL, Ada e INTI) que no usan LLVM ni GCC, y el formato
ejecutable que emiten (BEF2, propio: no hay ELF). Arranca en un AMD Ryzen
5 5600X **de verdad**, no en QEMU.

La documentacion tecnica esta en castellano --`BITACORA.md`, `ARQUITECTURA.md`,
`AVANCES.md` y todo `docs/`-- y este README en ingles a proposito: es la puerta
de entrada, y la conversacion de fuera ocurre en ingles. Lo que el sistema
IMPRIME en pantalla es castellano sin acentos, y eso tiene su propio motivo tecnico
(ver `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## The one sentence

**Authority is functional, never inherited.** What a process may do comes from
the handles it holds -- not from who launched it, what it is called, or which
user is logged in. There is no `root` to inherit from and no ambient permission
to escalate into.

The teller's process does not *fail a check* on a large transfer. **The
operation does not exist for it.**

Everything below is a consequence of that sentence, and the four other clauses
that follow from it are in **[ARQUITECTURA.md](ARQUITECTURA.md)** with the
mechanism that implements each one -- because a principle with no mechanism
under it is a slogan.

---

## Read this first: the three states

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟢 **Runs on metal** | Seen working on the real Ryzen, with a photo or a telemetry line |
| 🟡 **Written, never executed** | Compiles, links, passes its tests -- and no CPU has ever run it |
| ⚪ **Design only** | Documented, not built |

**Only 🟢 counts as done.** Nothing is green because it *should* work.

---

## 🟢 What the silicon has actually done

| | |
|---|---|
| Boots UEFI -> Ring 0 -> Ring 3 | kernel up at **47 ms**. The desktop's 1.100 ms nap was removed on 2026-09-08 -- it now waits only if something was **not** handed over; the new figure is not yet measured on metal |
| Runs its own compilers' output | COBOL, C, C++, Ada and INTI binaries, launched from disk |
| Its own executable format, on metal | **BEF2** (2026-09-20): a 64-byte header with four fixed regions -- the page permission comes from *where* a region sits, not from a flag -- and a signature that covers the index, every region and every attachment. ELF is gone from the tree; the desktop and DOOM booted on it the day it landed |
| Three languages in one program | C, C++ and INTI compile to the same `.bo` object and `bmo-enlazar` links them into one `.bex` -- a C `main` calling an INTI function and a C++ class, `42 42 7`, in the host bank |
| Decimal arithmetic that is exact | a bank batch totalling `$1,135.00` from a file it read |
| USB keyboard and mouse | xHCI + HID written here, no BIOS help |
| Disk | AHCI, FAT32 read *and* write, plus ESTRATOS, its own copy-on-write volume |
| 12 cores | SMP bring-up, `12 of 12` |
| Ring 3 isolation | a fault kills the task; the kernel takes the screen back and prints its last four lines |
| Traps its own undefined behaviour | INTI `llano` on the Ryzen: overflow, divide-by-zero and bad conversion all caught **in metal** |
| Plays DOOM | full width with the status bar, 1600x1000 scaled x5, **58 fps** in a window -- every pixel expanded and blitted by the CPU, no GPU. Played to the character's death on 2026-09-20 on the new format and the new C emitter (**-59 %** instructions on the metro, hybrid register calling convention), which no CPU had run before that day |
| 12 cores doing real work | a kernel-side workload measured at **11,52x** over one core |
| Explains its own crashes in Spanish | a page fault inside the framebuffer prints `ESCRIBIA EN LA PANTALLA QUE YA NO ES SUYA -- fila 231`, not just an address |
| Both frozen syscalls in use | `WAIT` had **one** call site in the whole repo until 2026-09-08 -- and it was a plain sleep. The compositor is now its first real user, blocking on the hardware beat. ⚠ It still spins when the machine is idle (nobody else is Ready, so the scheduler has nowhere to switch); that is `P2.2` in [`PLAN_EL_PLAZO.md`](docs/plan/PLAN_EL_PLAZO.md) |
| Survives its own userspace dying | DOOM launched **five times**, Ring 3 killed in between, the system never broke |
| Measures where its own second goes | the taskbar shows `latido N/s  pinta N  cuerpo Nms  puerta Nms` -- loop rate, frames that painted, and the split between working and waiting for a turn |
| Shows images | PNG (own inflate) and JPEG (integer IDCT) decoded and painted in a window on the Ryzen (2026-09-21); zoom is next |
| Writes its own report | `save` from the desktop: seven chapters (machine, memory, consumption, programs, disk, autopsy) as sheets in `informe/`, plus `DATOS.TXT` -- the same numbers as `capitulo.clave = valor unidad`, one per line, for a machine to read (2026-09-21) |
| The orchestrator enforces rank | a kernel thread declares `(period, budget)`; the tick charges every turn, a thread that overruns is set aside until its period ends, and `save` prints `incumplio` per thread. Measured on metal the day it landed: the USB bus, `4 ms / 3000 us`, went from 176 overruns to 20 once the real culprit was found |
| Enumerates USB without freezing the mouse | a mute device on port 1 cost the bus thread **933 ms per attempt**, felt as stutter. Enumeration is now a state machine advanced one step per 4 ms pump; the worst pump measured on the Ryzen went from 932.898 us to **7.922 us** (2026-09-21) |
| The kernel stack cannot leak silently | 16 KiB was overrun by one syscall path (the desktop died at DOOM launch); it is 32 KiB now, and `pila.py` reads every frame from the disassembly and refuses a build whose deepest path does not fit. Confirmed: DOOM launched, played and closed with `ningun fallo de Ring 3` |

![BMO-X booting](docs/evidencia/15-arranque.gif)

A short edited piece: title card, then the machine coming up, from the
firmware's own boot picker to BMO-X. **[Same thing as video, with sound and at
full size](https://github.com/AndreeSalazar/BMO-X/blob/main/docs/evidencia/15.mp4)**
(7 s, 848x480).

The unbroken take for the sceptic is a different recording and is
**[described here](docs/evidencia/)** -- it has not been shot yet.

> **Booted by the firmware, not by a loader.** The motherboard's own boot picker
> lists `BMO-X` next to `Windows Boot Manager` -- no Ventoy, no GRUB, no
> hypervisor, no QEMU. A system launched from inside a multi-boot loader can be
> dismissed as a payload; one the firmware itself boots cannot.
>
> The stills, the test bench and what each one proves:
> **[docs/evidencia/](docs/evidencia/)**.

**The rescue that makes the rest safe**: `Ctrl+Alt+ESC` returns keyboard *and*
screen to the kernel from any program, checked at the one point in Ring 0 every
key passes through. A program that holds both cannot keep the machine hostage --
whether the cause is malice or a missing `if`.

Photographs, telemetry and the exact dates: **[AVANCES.md](AVANCES.md)**.

## Try it yourself

### 1. Build it. This touches no disk.

```powershell
.\bmo.ps1
```

That is the whole thing: seventeen compatibility rules, the ASCII sweep, the
syscall contract across kernel/ABI/userland, four compilers, the kernel, the
desktop, and thirty programs. About a minute, and **it cannot write to any
drive** -- deploying is a separate command on purpose. Add `-Rapido` to skip the
test bench while you iterate.

### 2. Put it on a USB stick and boot it.

```powershell
.\desplegar.ps1 -Arranque E -Datos E
```

**Those two letters are Windows drive letters of the stick you are writing to.**
Nothing else. They are separate because BMO-X deploys two different things:

| flag | what lands there | what it must be |
|---|---|---|
| `-Arranque` | `EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI` -- **the entire operating system, one file** | a **FAT32** partition the firmware can boot (an ESP) |
| `-Datos` | `BMO-DATA\` -- the desktop and the programs | any FAT32 volume BMO-X can read |

On a normal USB stick with one FAT32 partition **both are the same letter**, and
that is the usual case. They stay separate because they are two different risks:
`-Arranque` decides what the firmware runs, `-Datos` only decides what is on the
menu. Getting the first wrong and the second right is how you spend an evening
testing yesterday's kernel without noticing.

> [!] **Check the letter twice.** Whatever is on that drive gets overwritten.
> `.\bmo.ps1` with no flags is always safe; `.\desplegar.ps1` is the one that
> writes. That split is the only reason it exists.
>
> The script refuses an NTFS volume rather than reporting a false success, so
> pointing it at a Ventoy payload partition fails loudly instead of quietly.

### 2b. Or skip the script entirely -- copy two things onto a stick.

The build leaves a folder that *is* the layout of a bootable stick, so **copying
it needs nothing but a file manager** -- Linux, macOS or Windows:

```text
Ultra_kernel_x86-64/staging/
    EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI      <- the whole operating system
    EFI/BOOT/BMO-MANIFEST.TXT <- sizes and SHA-256, for checking
    BMO-DATA/                 <- the desktop and the programs
```

1. Format a USB stick as **FAT32** (not exFAT, not NTFS -- UEFI reads FAT).
2. Copy **the contents of `staging/`** to the root of the stick, so that the
   stick ends up with `EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI` and `BMO-DATA\` at its top level.
3. That is the whole deployment. There is no bootloader to install, no
   `grub.cfg`, no initrd, no kernel command line, and nothing to configure.

> **[!] Where `staging/` comes from, said straight.** It is produced by
> `build.ps1`, and **that script only runs on Windows today** -- it looks for
> `llvm-objcopy.exe` under `%USERPROFILE%\.rustup` and hardcodes `.exe` paths.
> So *copying* needs no Windows and *producing* still does, and saying only the
> first half would be a half-truth.

> If that page is empty when you read this, the archive is not up yet and
> building on Windows is the only path -- which is worth knowing before you

**Why it is that simple**: UEFI firmware looks for `EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI` on any
FAT volume and runs it. BMO-X *is* that file -- boot chain, kernel and drivers
in one binary -- so there is nothing left for a bootloader to do. Ventoy, GRUB
and rEFInd all exist to choose between things and hand off; here there is
nothing to hand off to.

That also means the firmware's own boot menu lists it directly, next to
`Windows Boot Manager`, which is what photo 1 in
**[docs/evidencia/](docs/evidencia/)** shows.

### 3. Turn Secure Boot off first.

**This is the one that will waste your evening otherwise.** `BOOTX64.EFI` is not
signed by a key your firmware trusts, so a machine with Secure Boot enabled --
which is most machines shipped in the last decade -- **refuses to load it** and
says something like `Security Violation`. That is not a bug in BMO-X and there
is nothing to debug: the firmware never ran a single instruction of it.

It is in the BIOS setup, usually under *Boot* or *Security*, and it is one
toggle. Turn it back on afterwards if you want -- Windows does not care either
way as long as it was not installed in a mode you are changing.

> Signing the boot chain properly is on the roadmap and blocked behind the same
> thing everything else is: **cryptography**. Until then, "turn it off" is the
> honest instruction and not an oversight. See
> **[SEGURIDAD_MAESTRO.md](docs/maestro/SEGURIDAD_MAESTRO.md)** section 4.3 for
> why measured boot is *refused* rather than pending.

### 4. Reboot and pick it.

Open the firmware's boot menu -- it is a key pressed right after power-on, and
which key depends on the board: **F11** on MSI, **F12** on Gigabyte and Lenovo,
**F8** on ASUS, **F9** on HP, **Esc** on many others. If you miss it, the BIOS
setup itself (**Del** or **F2**) has a boot-order page that does the same thing.

Pick `BMO-X` and you are in. Click the
DOOM icon, or type `info`, `cpu`, `mem`, `ls` in the launcher. `Ctrl+Alt+ESC`
always takes the machine back from whatever is running.

### What actually gets written

Measured from a real build, not estimated:

| | bytes | what it is |
|---|---:|---|
| `BOOTX64.EFI` | **1.264.640** | boot chain + 2 stages + the Ring 0 kernel. **This one file is the OS** |
| `sys/d.bex` | 963.232 | the desktop and compositor -- Ring 3, loaded from disk |
| 38 more programs | 376.465 | C, C++, COBOL, Ada and INTI examples, all compiled here, all BEF2 |
| `apps/doom.bex` | 731.280 | optional, GPL, built only if the port is present (was 912 KB before the C emitter's September campaign) |
| `apps/doom1.wad` | 4.196.020 | id Software's shareware data, not ours |

**The operating system is 1,2 MiB.** Not the kernel -- the boot chain, the
kernel, the drivers, the filesystems, USB, AHCI and the capability engine, in a
single file the firmware loads. It uses **5,4 MiB of RAM** once running.

### Why it is that small, and it is not cleverness

It is the same rule that shows up everywhere else in this repository:

```text
   hardware   ->  PROFILED   named exactly; swapping it swaps a table
   software   ->  CONTRACT   names nobody, so it works for everyone
```

`amdgpu` is millions of lines because it supports fifteen years of cards:
runtime block discovery, dozens of firmware sets, a register map per generation.
**That is the price of being generic, and it is not paid here.** BMO-X carries
one CPU profile, one xHCI, one AHCI. Add no libc, no dynamic linker, no LLVM
runtime and no POSIX layer, and 1,16 MiB is just what is left.

The cost is written down and it is real: **this has been verified on exactly one
machine** -- an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X on an MSI A320M PRO MAX. On yours it may not
boot at all.

> **If it does not boot, that is the single most useful thing you can send me.**
> Photograph the screen where it stops, with your CPU and motherboard, and open
> an issue. A panic from unknown hardware is worth more than a pull request.
> See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**.

### And one command that only reads

```powershell
.\limpiar.ps1
```

Says what the build trees weigh before you delete anything. Cargo leaves about
5,7 GB across four workspaces. It deletes nothing unless you add `-Borrar`.

---

## Why it is built this way

Five decisions carry the whole design. Each is stated with what it costs,
because a trade-off with only one side written down is advertising.

**Two syscalls, frozen.** `INVOKE` and `WAIT`. Everything else -- opening a file,
reading the mouse, claiming the screen -- is an *operation* on a capability. The
API grows inside the pair (object kind, operation); the ABI does not move. The
proof it works is a number: **the doors went 3 -> 2 while the operations went
22 -> 127.** The system grew and the surface shrank -- and the build prints that
second number on every run (`operaciones kernel<->ABI: 127 comprobadas, ninguna
a mano`), so it is checked, not claimed.
*Cost*: every new ability needs a handle kind to hang from, so there is no quick
way to add "just one syscall".

**Its own compilers, and its own format.** COBOL, C, C++, Ada and INTI,
straight to machine code and BMO's own **BEF2** container: 64-byte header,
four regions in fixed slots, one relocation kind, a signature that is *of the
index* (header and attachment table) and of every region and attachment. No
LLVM, no libc, no ELF. There *is* a linker now -- `bmo-enlazar`, static only,
and it joins C, C++ and INTI objects without knowing which language wrote them.
*Cost*: every bug in every language is ours, and a missing corner of C is found
by a program that dies, not by a spec.

**An abstraction may save you work; it may not lie.** An unimplemented feature is
**rejected with a reason, never stubbed to look like it works**. A global the
compiler cannot evaluate is an error rather than a silent zero. When `info`
reports 8.4 MiB, that number comes from the kernel and not from the program
claiming it.
*Cost*: more paths that say no, and more code to say why.

**Writing *is* committing.** ESTRATOS is copy-on-write: the audit trail is not a
logging product bolted on, it is what the filesystem leaves behind. The write
window is **named, per volume**, and the owner's Windows loader is outside every
one of them.
*Cost*: space, and a sealing step that has to be deliberate.

**Survive the fall.** A cat falls, breaks something, and walks away. Not the
absence of failure -- surviving it and being able to say what happened.
*Cost*: the kernel carries autopsy machinery it hopes never to use.

  <img src="docs/arte/inti.png" alt="INTI -- habla con la CPU" width="360">
</p>

## The Hopper test

Grace Hopper's argument was never *"computers should be friendly"*. It was
sharper than that: **the machine should carry the work the human was carrying
by hand.** She wrote the first compiler in 1952 after being told computers only
did arithmetic, and she pushed FLOW-MATIC and then COBOL so a program could be
*read* by the person who owned the problem.

BMO-X is built by one author, for that author's machine. So the test is a fair
one to run, and here it is run with evidence rather than with flattery.

### 1. COBOL is native here, and that is not nostalgia

COBOL compiles straight to machine code in this tree -- **226 test rows**, exact
decimal, and real file I/O. It is the only one of the four front ends that
exists because *the problem domain asked for it* and not because the language
is popular.

And the decimal is the part that matters: Hopper's `PICTURE` clause is why
money can be counted without a float. Ada's Annex F later copied the same idea,
which is why **Ada's decimal was already paid for** when it arrived here.

### 2. Thirty-three guardians do the remembering

The A-0 automated *translation*. This tree automates *vigilance*. Every build
runs thirty-three guardians (`toolchain/tools/README.md` lists them) whose only
job is to say NO with a name: broken document citations, plan boxes that
cannot be checked, a module that grew past a thousand lines, a device that
reaches RAM without a census row, a commit scope that does not exist, a kernel
stack path that does not fit, a second CPU architecture growing in the tree.

One of them guards the language itself. Sources are ASCII and the screen
speaks Spanish without accents -- and a Spanish word that lost its **tilde
on the n** is not Spanish with an accent removed, it is a *broken* word:
the maimed form of *owner* means nothing, and the maimed form of *year* means
something else entirely. <!-- ene-caida-adrede --> Since 2026-09-21 the build fails on any
of them and the sweep replaces each with the word that survives whole
(`propietario`, `medida`, `mostrar`, `agregar`). A fork that switches that
guardian off stops being BMO-X on its first commit, and that is the point:
the rules travel inside the tree, not in anyone's memory.

None of that is the author's memory any more. **The machine holds the rules so
the person can hold the problem** -- which is the same trade the compiler made,
one floor up.

### 3. The nanosecond, still

Hopper handed out 30 cm wires so people could *see* a nanosecond. This codebase
has the same reflex written as law: **hardware is PROFILED, never estimated**
(LEY 24). A door costs 656 measured ticks and the build can show the split
between fixed cost and work. A `rdtsc` costs 112 ticks. A blit
is timed against the scan-out, not guessed.

The proof that this is a habit and not a slogan is that **it keeps correcting
the author**. In September a counter reported 2.467.697 microseconds of device
silence -- a plausible number, printed by working code. It was wrong: the disk
was not silent, it was *idle*, and the measurement had never checked whether
there was outstanding work. No test caught that. The machine did, by printing
the number where it could be looked at.

### 4. And her most quoted line earned its keep this week

> *The most damaging phrase in the language is: "we've always done it this
> way."*

Idle cores in BMO-X spun at 100 % because waking them needed an inter-processor
interrupt, which needed per-CPU state, which was exactly the work the module
was built to avoid. That reasoning was correct and it was answering the wrong
question: **those cores were not waiting for an interrupt, they were waiting
for a memory write.** `MWAITX` sleeps on a write. `hlt` was never the tool --
it was the habit. Measured on the Ryzen: **57,2 W with twelve cores up,
against 58,9 W with one** -- twelve now cost less than one did.

### 5. And the strictness is not the opposite of that -- it is what protects it

This section used to say the comparison *stopped* at strictness. That was the
wrong reading, and the author corrected it: **strictness is not a departure
from Hopper's argument, it is the thing that makes it hold.**

You do not delegate to something that can lie to you. The moment a compiler
quietly emits a stub that looks like it works, or a kernel reports a number the
program made up, the work comes straight back to the human -- who now has to
verify everything, which is more work than before the machine helped.

```text
   strict WITH THE USER      puts obstacles in the way          -> it gets in the way
   strict WITH ITSELF        refuses to be corrupted            -> you can let go
```

*** BMO-X is the second one, and the difference is the whole point. The rules
do not point at the person using the system: **they point inward**. An
unimplemented feature is refused with a reason instead of stubbed. For sixteen
days a `.bex` shipped with `sig_algo = 0` and the trust anchor empty -- written
down as a debt with a name rather than hidden behind a green check, and paid on
2026-09-10 when the debt turned out to be a missing command rather than missing
cryptography. The thirty-three guardians exist to say NO to *this codebase*, not to
its users.

> A system that lets itself be corrupted does not stop working for its owner.
> It starts working for whoever corrupted it -- and the owner is the last to
> find out.

That is why the two halves belong together and are not a compromise between
them: **the machine can carry the work precisely because it will not lie about
having carried it.** Hopper's delegation needs BMO-X's refusal to be worth
anything, and the refusal would be pointless bureaucracy without the
delegation.

### [!] Where it really does differ

Hopper wanted programming open to *anyone*, and the English keywords in COBOL
were an accessibility argument. BMO-X is not aiming at that: it is one author's
machine first, and [`FUERO/`](FUERO/) and [REX](toolchain/forge/sem-asm/tables/bmo/) exist so
third parties
can build on it **on stated terms**, not so the system fits everyone.

The divergence is the audience. It was never the strictness.

---

## Why INTI exists

**INTI is the system language of BMO-X.** Python's syntax, assembly's control,
and a compiler that will not leave a single operation without a rule. It
compiles straight to `.bex`, it runs on the Ryzen, and its checks reach real
bytes -- not a document.

### C is not dead here. It was demoted.

C still compiles, is still tested, and stays. It is the only way to run the C
that already exists in the world, and that is worth keeping. What changed is
narrower and final: **BMO-X stops writing *new* system code in C.**

The reason is one clause C wrote in 1972 and never revisited. Undefined
behaviour was a *portability* bargain -- dozens of incompatible machines, tiny
compilers, and no honest way to say what a signed overflow meant on all of them
at once. It was the right trade **then**.

Fifty years later the clause had not moved, but what it bought had switched
sides: the compiler stopped reading it as *"anything may happen"* and started
reading it as *"this cannot happen, therefore I may delete the code around it."*
The programmer never agreed to the second reading. He inherited it.

And here the bargain has nothing left to buy: **one machine, one toolchain, and
every source in the tree.** There is no foreign compiler to stay compatible with
and no unknown architecture to hold the door open for. Keeping undefined
behaviour in BMO-X costs everything and purchases nothing.

### The evidence is from this house, not from a paper

The strongest argument for INTI was not argued. It was found:

| what the emulator did | what the silicon actually does |
|---|---|
| `cvttsd2si` **saturated** -- `1e30` gave the largest integer, NaN gave zero | returns the most negative value as a sentinel, for both |
| `imul` **set no flags** | sets `cf` and `of` when the product does not fit |

Both holes sat in the emulator for months while BMO C compiled against them, and
nobody noticed. **They surfaced the week INTI arrived, and the reason is exact:
BMO C never emits a `jo`.** There was no one to ask the question.

On **2026-08-22** the question was put to the real Ryzen 5 5600X. The probe line
`reglas` came back `0x00`: overflow trapped as `1001`, divide-by-zero as `1003`,
bad conversion as `1012`. **The emulator and the metal agree** -- which is the
only way "INTI has no undefined behaviour" stops being a claim about an emulator
we wrote ourselves.

### The cost, stated

The checks cost about **1%**. Three of the four rules that matter reach bytes and
run; the rest are 🟡 or ⚪ and the tracker says which. `INTI PLENO` -- text,
lists, tables, exact decimal -- **is not built**, and the compiler refuses to
emit a signed binary for it rather than emitting one that quietly returns zeros.

### The first tool, and what writing it found (2026-09-12)

`bico.inti` converts BMP and QOI images into BICO, the format the desktop
paints. It is the job INTI is for: **reading bytes someone else wrote.** The
famous image-library bugs are lying headers overflowing a buffer; here every
size from the file is checked against what arrived, arithmetic traps instead of
wrapping, and the only two unchecked (`crudo`) blocks are counted in the binary.
Its tests feed it truncated, compressed and 3x60000-pixel files: each gets an
error code and no output file.

Writing real programs also surfaced **three silent emitter bugs, all present
since day one**: `and`/`or` emitted nothing (`a and b` returned `a`); the wait
call went through the wrong gate and spun instead of sleeping; and a variable
loaded into `r8`-`r10` produced an instruction of the wrong length. Each one
compiled, ran, and did something else. Each now has a test.

## What it deliberately does not do

No networking stack, no GPU driver, no dynamic linking, no processes talking
over sockets, no package manager, no accounts. Some of those are queued and some
are refused; **[ARQUITECTURA.md](ARQUITECTURA.md)** says which is which and why.

It is also not a Linux, not a hobby OS aiming at POSIX, and not trying to run
anybody else's binaries. A program for BMO-X is compiled for BMO-X. And it is
not portable: **x86-64 only**, one repository, one architecture -- the title
says so and a guardian enforces it.

---

## The second objective: **the day the card arrives, it gets profiled**

The primary objective is banking on BMO-X. This is the one behind it, and it is
stated here because the *shape* of the work is the point, not the hardware.

> **Target: AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB** (Navi 44 / GFX1200), declared
> 2026-08-02 in `platform/drivers/gpu/rdna4/`. Intended as a **Ring 3** driver
> -- and it would be the **first**: every device driver today is a Rust crate the
> Ring 0 kernel links. That gap is stated, not glossed over.

### Why this is one day of work and not a project

**BMO-X profiles hardware. It does not write generic drivers.** That is the law
of the house, and it is why the estimate is not the one people expect:

```text
   hardware   ->  PROFILE    named exactly; swapping it swaps a table,
                             never an edit to the kernel
   software   ->  CONTRACT   names nobody, and therefore works for everyone
```

`amdgpu` is millions of lines because it supports fifteen years of cards:
runtime block discovery, dozens of firmware sets, a register map per generation,
power management for each. **That is the price of being generic, and it is not
paid here.** What gets written is one device id, one firmware set, one register
map. The same rule the CPU already follows -- *"swapping the CPU is a profile
swap, never a kernel edit"* (`cpu_vendor/profile.rs`).

The profile is also what makes the metal **testable**: it says *this card, this
MAC, this register*, so the answer can be written down before looking and then
compared. A driver that claims "any AMD card" has no experiment that can confirm
or refute it.

** So the arrival of the card is the trigger, and the work is filling in a
profile that is already written and already waiting -- `PROFILE.pci_devices` is
an empty list today, because **a profile refuses to claim a card it has never
met**.

### Why AMD, and it is not a preference

The RTX 3060 came first, and that path was **reverse engineering**. With AMD the
path is open, and that is the whole reason:

| | |
|---|---|
| firmware | published in `linux-firmware`, and **redistributable** |
| the RDNA ISA | **published by AMD** |
| a reference driver | `amdgpu` is open and **can be read** |

That turns the question from *"is it possible"* into *"how much"*.

### Two goals, kept apart on purpose

| | goal A | goal B |
|---|---|---|
| what | **SDMA**, the copy engine | command rings, compute, Vulkan |
| size | *"the size of the AHCI driver"* | the long road |
| why A is small | **the display is not touched**: it inherits the linear framebuffer UEFI left and skips DCN entirely | -- |
| what it buys | the compositor blit -- which at 1600x1000 is DOOM's **entire** deficit | Vulkan in Ring 3 |

Confusing *"make the blit fast"* with *"run Doom Eternal"* is the classic way to
finish neither.

### And the one piece that is honestly not measured

Goal B has a wall: the **PSP**, the security processor that authenticates the
microcode before the GPU will run. A profile shrinks *variants*; it does not
shrink a handshake.

**No number is given for it here, and that is deliberate.** The plan that
describes it says *"do not write a schedule for this until you have looked at
it"*, and the house rule is older than the plan: **a device is asked, never
assumed**. Measuring it costs a day of reading `amdgpu` and counting the steps
-- no hardware, no money -- and until that day the honest answer is *not
measured*, which is not the same as *long*.

The full reasoning: **[PLAN_VULKAN.md](platform/drivers/gpu/rdna4/PLAN_VULKAN.md)**
and **[PLAN_EL_ASISTENTE.md](docs/plan/PLAN_EL_ASISTENTE.md)**.

## What is next, and what blocks it

The plans are public because an estimate nobody can check is advertising. Each
row below is **work on top of something that already runs**, except the last one.

| | | blocked by |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 | **Talk to the LAN and to the internet** -- receives, transmits behind a one-time gate with a 4 ms radar, gets its own IP by DHCP, and `ping` is answered by the router and by a server on the internet (2026-09-14) | done on metal |
| 🟡 | **Give the 12 cores work from Ring 3** -- the door is built (`ATRIL` / `TOCAR`, two operations, a closed catalogue of parts) and the kernel side already measured **11,52x** | one boot: `smp orquesta` has never been executed |
| 🟡 | **A LAN that works and is measured** -- `ping` works; DNS, files and banking terminals against a local server come next | DNS answers, then TCP on the metal |
| ⚪ | **Cloud local** -- your phone does the web and BMO-X shows it (see below) | TCP on the metal, then a local MPEG-1 player |
| 🟡 | **Sound** -- the headset is claimed by the enumerator with its descriptor in hand, volume and the isochronous pipe are driven by the bus thread (never from a syscall), the pipe opens itself on claim, and enumeration is done in **two beats** of its own: first the host *listens* to the device at address 0 to learn how it speaks (its EP0 packet), then a clean reset, the address and the papers -- each step justified by the USB and xHCI specs, not by what another host does. Written 2026-09-21; the first image shipped with two extra steps that left keyboard and mouse out, found by reading and removed 2026-09-22 | the next boot: the `save` says whether the 7.1 headset answered |
| ⚪ | **A local assistant**, running as a Ring 3 app over your own files -- parked by decision; its step 0 (closed decisions over `DATOS.TXT`, no model) needs nothing | `exp`, and the core door |
| ⛔ | **Anything over the internet** | **cryptography** -- and that is the ceiling |

**The ceiling has a name.** Everything above it is work; cryptography is the one
piece that is an *invention*. X25519, AES-GCM, SHA-256, X.509 -- written wrong it
does not fail, it **works and does not protect**.

And it is the same debt twice: the elliptic curve HTTPS needs is the one a signed
`.bex` needs. **Paying it once collects twice.**

> **[!] This paragraph used to say** *"today `verify_ed25519` says yes to a
> signature of zeros, and nothing calls it yet"*. **That has been false since
> 2026-08-24**, when that function was deleted, and real Ed25519 landed the day
> after. `bmo-firma` verifies against a trust anchor and refuses without one.
>
> The accurate statement was narrower and still uncomfortable: **the machinery
> worked and nothing signed shipped through it.** Every `.bex` went out with
> `sig_algo = 0` -- integrity, not authorship -- and the trust anchor was empty.
> The gap was never the algorithm; it was that **nothing in the tree could
> sign**, which is why the writer emitted a zero and the anchor had nothing to
> hold.
>
> **Closed on 2026-09-10.** `toolchain/tools/bmo-firmar` signs an already-built
> `.bex` in place -- the signature is the one block no hash covers, so stamping
> it moves nothing else, and what gets signed is the binary that was tested
> rather than a rebuilt sibling. It links `bmo-firma`, the same crate the kernel
> runs, so "verified on the host" and "verified on the metal" are one claim and
> not two that resemble each other. The private key never enters the repository:
> the tool walks the ancestors for a `.git` and refuses. The anchor now holds one
> key, by name.
>
> What is still open is honest and small: **no signed `.bex` has booted on the
> Ryzen yet**, and `exige_firma()` is still `false`. Both are checkboxes with a
> verification written next to them, in `docs/plan/PLAN_SEGURIDAD.md`.

machine gives without buying anything) and
**[PLAN_EL_ASISTENTE.md](docs/plan/PLAN_EL_ASISTENTE.md)**.

> **On estimates.** A profile here measures between **600 and 1.900 lines** --
> that is four measurements, not an opinion: the Ryzen profile is 952, AHCI is
> 1.103, xHCI is 1.871. Where a number has not been measured, this repository
> says *not measured* rather than guessing. That is not modesty; a guess written
> down becomes a fact three months later.

## Cloud local: the phone is the antenna

YouTube will not run on BMO-X, and the reason is not the kernel. A video site
needs HTTPS, a JavaScript engine, a modern codec and synchronized audio, and each
of those is months of work. **Cloud local** moves all four out of the machine:

```text
   ANTENNA (an Android phone, or any PC)                 BMO-X
   the web, TLS, JavaScript, the codec   -- home LAN --> MPEG-1 + MP2 640x360 over TCP,
   converted live to MPEG-1 + MP2           plain        drawn with pl_mpeg in a window
```

It is Steam Link turned around: for the web the phone is the powerful machine and
BMO-X is the screen. No PCIe, no driver for somebody else's GPU, and no POSIX
smuggled in -- the dirty work stays outside, on a device that already does it.

- **On the phone:** Termux, Python and ffmpeg. The first mode needs no app: the
  antenna is [`toolchain/tools/antena/antena.py`](toolchain/tools/antena/antena.py),
  and [`cliente.py`](toolchain/tools/antena/cliente.py) tests it from a PC before
  BMO-X speaks TCP.
- **On BMO-X:** TCP on the metal, the `ANTENA/1` protocol
  ([`platform/shared/bmo-antena`](platform/shared/bmo-antena), tested on the host)
  and a local MPEG-1 player.
- **What it refuses to promise:** the channel is not encrypted, so it is for one
  home LAN and one allowed IP; without the antenna there is no video; and what a
  video platform's terms allow is the antenna owner's call. The antenna serves
  files that are already in its folder -- it downloads nothing.

BMO-X keeps **two paths** to the network, and they are split by what each one
is allowed to accept, not by the wire (both run over `bmo-pila` and the same
kernel gate):

```text
   DIRECT    protocols that fit in one page of RFC -- DHCP, DNS, ping (done on
             the metal), TCP, Gemini, a plain HTTP GET -- against servers that
             speak BMO-X's language: a repository of SIGNED `.bex`, another
             BMO-X, a NAS at home. Never JavaScript, never a browser
   ANTENNA   the web, sessions, codecs, Python: chewed on the phone (or on a
             stripped-down Linux box) and handed over as simple data, with a
             quota and a quarantine if the antenna misbehaves
```

A signed `.bex` may travel in the clear: the signature protects the content,
TLS would only protect the channel. Anything private stays at home until TLS
(the wall) exists. And "browsing" without becoming a browser is a third shape
between text and screen mirroring: the antenna runs the whole browser and sends
the page **already laid out** -- boxes, text runs, images -- the way Opera Mini
did in 2005, except the server is your own phone on your own LAN. Measured on
2026-09-16 in a desktop browser: a Wikipedia article at 640 px is ~2.100 lines and
90 KB once the page is laid out with BMO-X's own 8x16 font metrics, and the
reader (`bmo-antena/src/lamina.rs`, 30 tests) accepts every line. And the
phone already does it by itself: `PAGINA <url>` to a HONOR X7a running the
antenna in Termux (Chromium inside a proot Debian) returns that Wikipedia
article laid out in 2.5 s over the LAN (7 s before the antenna stopped
loading images nobody would see and stopped opening a process per page --
no optimization, just subtraction; the layout is byte-for-byte the same).
The desktop does it in 0.5 s. Honest numbers, measured 2026-09-16.

## How to be suspicious of it

The claim worth checking is not "it works" -- it is that the things marked 🟢
were seen on the real machine and the things marked 🟡 say so.

- `.\bmo.ps1` builds everything and runs the guards **without touching any
  disk**: seventeen compatibility rules over 82 cases, sources are ASCII, 1.033
  document citations resolve, no module grew past its ceiling, and the syscall
  contract is compared across the kernel, the ABI and the userland runtime --
  **127 kernel operations and 94 userland ones, none by hand**. Deploying to a
  USB stick is a separate command, `.\desplegar.ps1`, on purpose.
- `.\limpiar.ps1` says what the build trees weigh before you delete them.
- `cargo test --workspace --exclude bmo-kernel` -- **2.433 tests, 0 failures**.
- `cargo test -p bmo-c-x86-64 probe_` -- **15 axes in 0,61 s**: the census of what
  the C compiler actually supports, including the rows that are still broken. A
  census that hides its red rows is worth nothing.

**[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** explains the bar for a change, and it is
two rules: nothing that compiles and does not do what it says -- and **Ring 0 is
closed to external contributions** (2026-09-17). Drivers and integrations go in
Ring 3 or on the Antena; the exact list is [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS).
