//! **The AudioStreaming side: where the samples travel.**
//!
//! Step 0 of `docs/maestro/AUDIO_MAESTRO.md`, and it is deliberately the one step that
//! **cannot break anything**: not a single byte is written to the device here.
//! This module reads a configuration descriptor and answers questions.
//!
//! # Why this is a module and not more lines in `lib.rs`
//!
//! Because they are two different jobs and the owner's rule is modular:
//!
//! | | |
//! |---|---|
//! | `lib.rs` | **AudioControl**: volume, mute. Commands *about* the device |
//! | this | **AudioStreaming**: the pipe the samples go through |
//!
//! They share the class constants and nothing else. `lib.rs` says so itself in
//! its line 51 -- *"the interface that carries samples is AUDIOSTREAMING (0x02)
//! and is not touched here"* -- and that sentence stops being a promise and
//! becomes a boundary the moment there are two files.
//!
//! # What it is for, in one line
//!
//! Answering, **before writing any driver**, the four numbers that decide
//! whether the rest of the plan is even possible:
//!
//! ```text
//!    which interface and which alternate setting carry the isochronous endpoint
//!    how many bytes fit in one frame            (wMaxPacketSize)
//!    what shape the samples have                (channels, bits)
//!    and at what rate the device wants them     (sampling frequencies)
//!
//! ```
//!
//! And they can be **predicted before booting** by looking at what the other
//! operating system on this same machine says -- which is the method that
//! already worked twice: the `#GP` of July and the NIC's MAC.
//!
//! # The trap that this module exists to not fall into
//!
//! An AudioStreaming interface declares its endpoint **only in alternate
//! setting 1 or above**. Alternate setting 0 exists on purpose and has ZERO
//! endpoints: it is the "I am not using any bandwidth" mode, and a device sits
//! there until somebody sends a `SET_INTERFACE`.
//!
//! So a walker that tracks `bInterfaceNumber` and ignores `bAlternateSetting`
//! --which is exactly what `bmo_uhid::enumera::intr_in` does, correctly, because
//! HID has no alternate settings-- would find the interface, find no endpoint,
//! and conclude the device cannot play. **The device would be perfect.**
