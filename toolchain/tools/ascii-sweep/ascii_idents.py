"""ascii_idents -- de-accent Rust identifiers. Same spelling, ASCII letters.

This is the companion to `ascii_sweep` and it stops exactly where that one
does: it does NOT translate. `marcando` stays `marcando`; turning it into
`pointing` is a different job with different risks, and mixing the two would
make the diff impossible to review.

Why it is needed at all
=======================

`ascii_sweep` proved its guarantee by refusing to touch anything outside a
comment -- which left a real case behind. In `platform/drivers/usb/input/foco.rs`
the tilde is not in a comment and not in a string: it is in the NAMES.

    marcando: Option<usize>          <- the field
    pub fn marcada(&self) -> ...     <- the method

Rust accepts Unicode identifiers, so this compiled and nobody noticed. But once
the comments around them were swept to ASCII, the comment and the code spelled
the same word two different ways -- and grep stopped finding one from the other.

What it will not touch
======================

Strings, because those are output. Comments, because `ascii_sweep` already did
them. Only identifiers, and only their accents.

The check that makes it safe is the compiler: a rename that misses an
occurrence, or invents one, does not build. So the verification is
`cargo check --workspace`, and it is not optional.

# identifier in Cyrillic, Greek or CJK **did not even match**, so the sweep
# walked past it and printed `clean`.
#
# That happened on 2026-08-21: a Cyrillic letter slipped into a test file and
# this tool reported no findings. A guard that answers `clean` for a case it
# cannot see is worse than no guard, because someone believed it.
