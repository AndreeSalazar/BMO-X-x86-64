//! **Where does each box go?** Top-down, and this is where boxes finally see
//! each other -- which is the son's product being *related*, so it is the
//! grandson's whole reason to exist.
//!
//! ## The two rules that answer "what is an undeclared size"
//!
//! The son recorded `None` rather than inventing a number, because the answer
//! depends on the neighbours. Here are the neighbours, so here is the answer:
//!
//! ```text
//!    block child, no width      -> the container's content width   (fills)
//!    flex item,   no main size  -> what its content needs          (shrinks)
//!    flex item,   no cross size -> the container's, if `stretch`
//! ```
//!
//! All three are CSS's, and that is the point: the answers had to be *somebody's*
//! and they had to be the browser's.
//!
//! ## Free space is signed, and stays signed
//!
//! `content - used` goes negative the moment something does not fit, and a box
//! centred inside a smaller one lands at a negative coordinate -- in a browser
//! too. Clamping it to zero here would hide an overflow that `verdict/` is
//! supposed to catch, so positions are `i32` and nothing saturates.
//!
//! It is the same trap the rasterizer wrote down: with the wrong width an
//! overflow flips the SIGN and the shape comes out inside out.
