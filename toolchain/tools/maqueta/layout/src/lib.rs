//! # MAQUETA -- LAYOUT, the grandson generation
//!
//! generacion: nieto
//!
//! **Relates a box to the boxes around it** and settles where each one lands.
//! L7: it does not know what is done with the numbers. There is no screen here,
//! no colour is read, nothing is painted, and no opinion is held about whether
//! the result is any good -- that is `verdict/`.
//!
//! ## * The two tables come from ONE pass, and that is the point
//!
//! `calc.rs` computes the geometry of a key twice today: once in `paint_calc` to
//! draw it, and once in `key_at` to know which key was pressed. Two copies of one
//! piece of arithmetic, and a whole class of bug -- the button that is drawn in
//! one place and answers in another.
//!
//! This generation knows every final rect, so [`Laid::hits`] and
//! [`Laid::islands`] fall out of the same tree that gets painted. The
//! duplication does not get fixed; it stops being possible.
//!
//! ## Coordinates are absolute, and signed
//!
//! Every rect is already in canvas coordinates, so the emitter never adds
//! anything up. And `x`/`y` are `i32` because a box centred in something smaller
//! than itself lands at a negative coordinate **in a browser too**. Clamping
//! would hide the overflow that `verdict/` exists to catch.
